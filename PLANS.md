# Autopilots OS Execution Plan

Status labels: `verified`, `inferred`, `proposed`, `blocked`.

## Current checkpoint — 2026-07-21

The Phase 0–3 sandbox lighthouse is implemented in `autopilots-platform`: personalized AI employee preview → requirements/legal gates → sandbox payment → Secure Data Room → internal workflow → versioned human approval. Server sessions, role policy, tenant scope, audit, execution evidence, kill switches, idempotency and an append-only demo cost ledger are verified by automated tests.

## Phase gates

- [x] Phase 0: inventory, baseline, risk containment and explicit demo boundary.
- [x] Phase 1: lighthouse, architecture, source truth, risks and decisions documented.
- [x] Phase 2: minimum server-governed platform for the lighthouse.
- [x] Phase 3 sandbox: reusable, measurable vertical slice with human approval.
- [ ] Phase 3 production: durable database, managed identity, real provider verification and deployment.
- [ ] Phase 4: deepen command center only after production foundation passes.
- [ ] Phase 5: add finance/delivery/marketing slices one evaluated workflow at a time.
- [ ] Phase 6: production hardening, SLOs, restore rehearsal and incident readiness.

## Next unblocked actions

1. Replace the in-memory repository with PostgreSQL and enforced row-level tenant policies.
2. Replace local demo credentials with managed authentication, memberships and MFA for internal operators.
3. Add a provider adapter contract and sandbox contract tests for Stripe first; keep live mode off.
4. Persist workflow checkpoints, approvals, audit and usage adjustments transactionally.
5. Add CI gates for tests, secret scanning and architecture fitness checks.

## Genuine blockers

- Production credentials and explicit authority for provider reads/writes.
- Selected hosting, managed database, identity provider and secrets vault.
- Approved legal document contents and production retention policy.
- A designated internal approver and escalation owner.

Rollback: stop `autopilots-platform`; the existing `sales-dashboard` remains untouched as the legacy operational application.
